## Overview

This is a **multi-domain LLM Wiki** — a persistent, compounding knowledge base maintained
entirely by you (the LLM agent). The human sources documents and asks questions.
You do all the writing, filing, cross-referencing, and bookkeeping.

Active domains:

| Domain ID   | Name              | Root folder          |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `DOMAIN_1`  | [Domain 1 Name]   | `wiki/DOMAIN_1/`     |
| `DOMAIN_2`  | [Domain 2 Name]   | `wiki/DOMAIN_2/`     |
| `DOMAIN_3`  | [Domain 3 Name]   | `wiki/DOMAIN_3/`     |

Cross-domain connections are valuable. When a concept appears in multiple domains,
note the link explicitly and create a cross-domain page under `wiki/shared/`.

> NOTE: You can have 1 domain or 10. Delete rows you don't need.
> A single-domain setup is perfectly valid — just use one domain ID throughout.

## SESSION EXPORT SYSTEM
## The layer that makes memory survive context compression

Every Claude Code session is automatically exported to markdown before the context
compresses. Exports are indexed in SQLite FTS5 — full-text searchable with no API
calls, no embeddings, no vector database. Just markdown and SQL.

### Three hooks

**PreCompact** — fires before context compression triggered by manual `/compact`.
**Does not fire for automatic context compression** (when the context limit is hit
mid-session). For auto-compacted sessions, SessionEnd is the only automatic safety net.

**SessionEnd** — fires when the session exits normally.
Catches short sessions that never triggered PreCompact.

**SessionStart** — fires when a new session begins.
Indexes any unindexed exports, prints last 3 sessions so you know where you left off.

### Manual recovery — when a session wasn't captured

The JSONL transcript stays on disk in `~/.claude/projects/` indefinitely.

**Easy path — sweep for everything recent:**
```bash
# Export all unexported sessions from the last 7 days, across all projects
python3 .claude/scripts/sweep-sessions.py --days 7

# Or check what would be exported first:
python3 .claude/scripts/sweep-sessions.py --days 7 --dry-run
```

**Single session recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Find the session JSONL
ls ~/.claude/projects/   # look for your project slug directory

# 2. Export it
python3 .claude/scripts/export-session.py \
  --trigger manual \
  --transcript ~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl

# 3. Index it
bash .claude/scripts/index-sessions.sh
```

Check `.claude/hooks.log` for a timestamped record of when hooks ran and
what failed — useful for diagnosing why a session went missing.

### Windows note — wikiexit alias

On Windows, the SessionEnd hook may not fire reliably when you type
`exit` to close Claude Code. Add these functions to your PowerShell
profile as a reliable alternative:

```powershell
# Run once in PowerShell to open your profile:
notepad $PROFILE

# Add these functions to the file, save, and close:
function wikiexit {
    # Export the current session
    python "YOUR_WIKI_PATH\.claude\scripts\export-session.py" `
           --trigger manual `
           --wiki-dir "YOUR_WIKI_PATH"
    # Sweep the last 7 days for any sessions missed by hooks
    # (catches auto-compacted sessions and unclean exits)
    python "YOUR_WIKI_PATH\.claude\scripts\sweep-sessions.py" `
           --days 7 `
           --wiki-dir "YOUR_WIKI_PATH"
}

function wikisweep {
    # Full historical sweep — export ALL unexported sessions ever
    # Run this once when setting up a new machine or after a long gap
    python "YOUR_WIKI_PATH\.claude\scripts\sweep-sessions.py" `
           --wiki-dir "YOUR_WIKI_PATH"
}

# Reload the profile in the current terminal:
. $PROFILE
```

Replace `YOUR_WIKI_PATH` with your actual wiki path.

After setup, your session closing ritual is:
```
exit        ← close Claude Code
wikiexit    ← export current session + sweep last 7 days
```

`wikiexit` works from any project directory. The sweep catches sessions
from all wired projects — not just the one you were working in.

For Mac/Linux, add the equivalent shell functions to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export WIKI_ROOT="$HOME/path/to/your-wiki"

wikiexit() {
    python3 "$WIKI_ROOT/.claude/scripts/export-session.py" --trigger manual
    python3 "$WIKI_ROOT/.claude/scripts/sweep-sessions.py" --days 7
}

wikisweep() {
    python3 "$WIKI_ROOT/.claude/scripts/sweep-sessions.py"
}
```

---

### Confidentiality controls

**Control 1 — Sentinel file** (skip export entirely):
```bash
touch .claude/no-export   # before starting a sensitive session
# or say "This session is confidential" at the first prompt
```
The sentinel auto-deletes after the session so the next session exports normally.

> **Important**: Do NOT customize the UserPromptSubmit trigger to a single
> common word like "confidential", "private", or "secret". These words appear
> naturally in work content and will silently block ALL session exports. Use
> the exact phrase `"this session is confidential"` or another unambiguous
> deliberate phrase.

**Control 2 — .exportignore** (export to disk but exclude from search index):
Add filename patterns to `.exportignore`. Files exist as backup but are never searchable.

**Control 3 — GPG encryption** (archive but lock):
```bash
# Export with confidential label → GPG-encrypted to sessions/confidential/
python3 .claude/scripts/export-session.py --trigger manual --label confidential
```

---

## Special Files

### wiki/index.md
Master catalog. **Update on every ingest — no exceptions.**
```
| [[path/to/page]] | One-line description | domain | date |
```
Organized by domain, then page type. The LLM reads this first on every query.

### wiki/log.md
Append-only. **Never edit past entries.**
```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | DOMAIN_1 | Source Title
## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | DOMAIN_2 | Question answered + filed
## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | all | Orphan check + contradiction scan
## [YYYY-MM-DD] digest | sessions | N sessions → M wiki pages
## [YYYY-MM-DD] update | DOMAIN_3 | Page updated from chat
```
Parseable: `grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -10`

---

## Operations

### INGEST — `> ingest [domain] raw/path/to/file.md`
1. Read the source from `raw/`
2. Brief 2–3 sentence takeaway discussion
3. Create `wiki/[domain]/sources/SLUG.md`
4. Update `wiki/index.md`
5. Update or create entity and concept pages touched by this source
6. Check for domain-specific implications (see Domain Conventions below)
7. Check for cross-domain connections → `wiki/shared/`
8. Append to `wiki/log.md`
9. Report: files created/modified, contradictions found

A single ingest typically touches 8–15 wiki pages. That is expected and good.

### QUERY — `> [question]`
1. Check past sessions: `bash .claude/scripts/recall.sh "[keywords]"`
2. Read `wiki/index.md` to find relevant pages
3. Read those pages, drill into linked pages as needed
4. Synthesize answer with inline citations: `[[wiki/domain/path]]`
5. Ask: *"Should I file this answer as a wiki page?"*

Good answers are knowledge — they should compound in the wiki, not disappear.

### RECALL — `> recall: [what you're looking for]`
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/recall.sh "your search terms"
bash .claude/scripts/recall.sh --recent 5
bash .claude/scripts/recall.sh --date 2026-03
```
Searches all indexed session exports. Falls back to grep if SQLite returns nothing.

### DIGEST — `> digest sessions`
Scan `sessions/exports/` for undigested sessions. Extract structured knowledge.
File as wiki pages. Move processed files to `sessions/wiki-digests/`.
Log: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] digest | sessions | N sessions → M wiki pages`

During digest, look for:
- Architecture decisions → concept pages
- Dead ends (what didn't work and why) → open questions on concept pages
- Discoveries → new source or concept pages
- Decisions made in conversation → update relevant domain pages

### LINT — `> lint` or `> lint [domain]`
Check for:
- Orphan pages (no inbound links)
- Contradictions between pages
- Stale claims superseded by newer sources
- Concepts mentioned but lacking their own page
- Missing cross-references between related pages
- Sessions older than 7 days not yet digested

Suggest: new sources to find, new questions worth pursuing.

### UPDATE — `> update [domain] [path]`
Update a specific wiki page from information provided in chat (no raw file needed).
Use for: quick corrections, meeting notes, decisions from conversations.

### CUSTOMIZE — `> customize`
Interactive walkthrough: replace DOMAIN_1/2/3 placeholders with real domain names,
configure domain-specific conventions, create domain-specific page formats.
Run this once when setting up a new wiki from this template.

### BOOTSTRAP — `> bootstrap`
After customization, create all directory structures, seed skeleton pages,
write the three hook scripts to `.claude/scripts/`, initialize `sessions.db`.

---

## Domain Conventions

> CUSTOMIZE THIS SECTION for each of your domains.
> Delete placeholder text and replace with domain-specific instructions.
> See examples/domains/ for worked examples.

### DOMAIN_1 — [Domain 1 Name]

**Purpose**: [What this domain covers]

**Key concept pages to seed early**:
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]

**Domain-specific page types**: [Any custom page formats beyond sources/concepts/entities]

**Special rules**: [Anything the LLM should always check or update for this domain]

---

### DOMAIN_2 — [Domain 2 Name]

**Purpose**: [What this domain covers]

**Key concept pages to seed early**:
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]

**Domain-specific page types**: [Any custom page formats]

**Special rules**: [Domain-specific LLM behavior]

---

### DOMAIN_3 — [Domain 3 Name]

**Purpose**: [What this domain covers]

**Key concept pages to seed early**:
- [Concept 1]
- [Concept 2]

**Domain-specific page types**: [Any custom page formats]

**Special rules**: [Domain-specific LLM behavior]

---

## Cross-Domain Connections

> List concept pairs that naturally bridge your domains.
> The LLM will watch for these and create wiki/shared/ pages when found.

Examples:
- [Concept A] (DOMAIN_1 ↔ DOMAIN_2)
- [Person or Org] (DOMAIN_2 ↔ DOMAIN_3)

---

## Tone and Judgment

- Write for the human who owns this wiki. Match their expertise level. Don't
  over-explain things they already know. Do flag things that are new or contradictory.
- Be direct about uncertainty. Surface contradictions — don't smooth them over.
- Prefer specificity over generality. Precise claims age better than vague ones.
- Short pages with good links beat long sprawling pages no one re-reads.
- The log and session exports are sacred — never edit history.

---

## Bootstrapping Sequence

```
> customize          # replace placeholders with your domain names and conventions
> bootstrap          # create directory structure, seed pages, write scripts
> bootstrap privacy  # create .gitignore, .exportignore, sessions/confidential/
> git init && git add wiki/ CLAUDE.md .exportignore .gitignore .claude/ && git commit -m "init wiki"
```

---

## Co-Evolution Note

This schema is a starting point, not a final spec. As your wiki grows, update this
file. If a convention isn't working, change it here and note the change in
`wiki/log.md`. If a new domain emerges, add it. The schema is code — keep it
maintained just like a codebase.
